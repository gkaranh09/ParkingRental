# Parking Space Rental Smart Contract

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
**Parking Space Rental on Aptos Blockchain**

---

## ðŸ“– Description
The **Parking Space Rental** smart contract is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language.  
It enables parking space owners to register their spaces with a defined hourly rate, and allows renters to pay directly for their parking duration using Aptos Coins (APT).  
All transactions are transparent, secure, and verifiable on-chain.

**Key Features:**
- Owners can **register** their parking spaces with a chosen hourly rate.
- Renters can **pay** for parking hours, transferring tokens directly to the owner.
- The contract keeps track of **total earnings** for each owner.
- No intermediaries â€” purely peer-to-peer.
